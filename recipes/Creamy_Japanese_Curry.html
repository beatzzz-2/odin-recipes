    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>For me, the aromatic and enticing scent of Japanese curry conjures memories of 
        living in Osaka. On a winter's day, I'd slide into the booth of a cosy Japanese restaurant and order a katsu curry (or 'kare rice') that would warm me from the inside out. 
        This recipe offers all the flavour, comfort and warmth of a full-bodied Japanese curry, while also being easy and speedy to make at home.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp peanut oil</li>
            <li>650g Lilydale Free Range Chicken Tenderloins</li>
            <li>1 small red onion, sliced into thin wedges</li>
            <li>3 blocks S&B Golden Curry Sauce Mix</li>
            <li>1 bunch broccolini, trimmed, halved lengthways</li>
            <li>270ml can coconut cream</li>
            <li>60g pkt baby spinach</li>
            <li>Lime wedges, to serve</li>
            <li>Coles White Medium Grain Rice, steamed, to serve</li>
        </ul>

    </p>
    
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a wok or frying pan over high heat. Add the chicken and cook, turning halfway, for 5 minutes or until nearly cooked through. Transfer to a plate.</li>
            
            <li>Add half the onion to the wok. Reduce heat to low and stir-fry for 1 minute or until soft. Add 375ml (1 1/2 cups) of water and the curry blocks. Cook, stirring for 1 minute or until the curry dissolves.</li>

            <li>Add the broccolini to the pan and simmer, stirring often, for 2 minutes or until broccolini is tender-crisp. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to the plate with the chicken.</li>

            <li>Add the coconut cream to the wok. Simmer for 5 minutes or until sauce has thickened. Use your fingers to tear the chicken into pieces. Add the chicken and broccolini to the wok with the spinach. Stir for 1 minute to heat through. Serve sprinkled with the remaining half onion, lime wedges and steamed rice. </li>
        </ol>
