    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>For me, the aromatic and enticing scent of Japanese curry conjures memories of 
        living in Osaka. On a winter's day, I'd slide into the booth of a cosy Japanese restaurant and order a katsu curry (or 'kare rice') that would warm me from the inside out. 
        This recipe offers all the flavour, comfort and warmth of a full-bodied Japanese curry, while also being easy and speedy to make at home.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp peanut oil</li>
            <li>650g Lilydale Free Range Chicken Tenderloins</li>
            <li>1 small red onion, sliced into thin wedges</li>
            <li>3 blocks S&B Golden Curry Sauce Mix</li>
            <li>1 bunch broccolini, trimmed, halved lengthways</li>
            <li>270ml can coconut cream</li>
            <li>60g pkt baby spinach</li>
            <li>Lime wedges, to serve</li>
            <li>Coles White Medium Grain Rice, steamed, to serve</li>
        </ul>

    </p>
    
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a 7cm-deep, 24cm round (base) frying pan over high heat. 
                Season chicken with salt and pepper. Add chicken to pan. 
                Cook for 4 to 5 minutes each side or until well browned and cooked through. 
                Transfer to a plate. Cover loosely with foil.</li>
            
            <li>Add garlic to pan. Cook for 30 seconds. Add wine and mustard. Boil for 1 minute, scraping base of pan, or until wine has reduced by half. 
                Add stock and water. Bring to the boil. Add pasta. Stir well. 
                Cook, covered, for 10 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes (scrape base of pan to make sure pasta doesnâ€™t stick) or until pasta is just tender.</li>

            <li>Add cream and spinach to pan. Stir until well combined. Add chicken and resting juices to pan. Season with salt and pepper. 
                Cook for 2 minutes or until spinach just starts to wilt. 
                Drizzle with extra cream. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
