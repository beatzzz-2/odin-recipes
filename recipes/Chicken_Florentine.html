    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a 7cm-deep, 24cm round (base) frying pan over high heat. 
                Season chicken with salt and pepper. Add chicken to pan. 
                Cook for 4 to 5 minutes each side or until well browned and cooked through. 
                Transfer to a plate. Cover loosely with foil.</li>
            
            <li>Add garlic to pan. Cook for 30 seconds. Add wine and mustard. Boil for 1 minute, scraping base of pan, or until wine has reduced by half. 
                Add stock and water. Bring to the boil. Add pasta. Stir well. 
                Cook, covered, for 10 minutes, stirring every 2 minutes (scrape base of pan to make sure pasta doesnâ€™t stick) or until pasta is just tender.</li>

            <li>Add cream and spinach to pan. Stir until well combined. Add chicken and resting juices to pan. Season with salt and pepper. 
                Cook for 2 minutes or until spinach just starts to wilt. 
                Drizzle with extra cream. Serve immediately.</li>
